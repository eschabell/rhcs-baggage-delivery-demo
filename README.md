App Dev Cloud with Baggage Delivery Demo
==============================================
This demo is to install JBoss BPM Suite based vacation request application in the Cloud based on leveraging the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). It delivers a fully functioning HR employee vacation request example containerized on OCP.

A baggage delivery service using BPM. A business friendly demo using form modeler, bpm process, decisions table web, spreadsheet, dsl and bam.  


Install on OpenShift
--------------------
1. First ensure you have an OpenShift container based installation, such as one of the followling installed first:

    - [OCP Install Demo](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo)

    - or your own OpenShift installation.

2. [Download and unzip this demo.](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/rhcs-baggage-delivery-demo/archive/master.zip)

3. Download JBoss EAP & JBoss BPM Suite, add to installs directory (see installs/README).

4. Run 'init.sh' or 'init.bat' file. 'init.bat' must be run with Administrative privileges.

Log in to JBoss BPM Suite to start exploring the baggage delivery application (the address will be generated by the init
script):

  - OCP example: http://rhcs-baggage-delivery-appdev-in-cloud.192.168.99.100.nip.io/business-central ( u:erics / p:bpmsuite1! )


Notes
-----
This project can be installed on any OpenShift platform, such as OpenShift Container Platform.
It's possible to install it on any available installation by pointing this installer to an OpenShift IP address:

```
  $ ./init.sh IP
```

-----

If for any reason the installation breaks or you want a new JBoss BRMS installation, just remove the project rhcs-bpms-install-demo
entry in the OpenShift console and re-run the installation.

-----


Running the demo
----------------
Build the project then kick off the process. An initial form will show for first name, last name, 
flyer status {None, Bronze, Silver, Gold}, Country Code, Zip if in US and number of bags lost.  

If in US, will pass in zip code to zip code web service. Only the following zip codes will return 
states. Any other zip will return Texas.

	  //Park Ridge, IL
		zipCodes.put("60068", "IL");
		
		//Honolulu, HI
		zipCodes.put("96801", "HI");
		
		//New York, NY
		zipCodes.put("10001", "NY");
		
		//Bethel, AK
		zipCodes.put("99559", "AK");

After zip code service is called, the state field on passenger is used in web decision table to 
determine the cost of shipping.  Next, a DSL is used to figure out a surcharge for AK and HI.  

If not in US, county code is looked up in spreadsheet decision table and sets shipping and surcharge.

Finally, DSL is used to apply a promotion of free shipping and surcharge if passenger is of status Gold. 
You are then shown the route the process took and the variables to confirm shipping and surcharges are correct.

See support directory for included spreadsheet decision table ( NonUSShippingCost.xls) and docs directory for 
an overview presentation of the project.
